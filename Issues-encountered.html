Issues encountered on Coffee Project

1.  We encountered an issue with our roast.selection values not matching
the values set for our select options. It would not allow us to properly
display the filtered results by roast. For example our property value set
for our object in our js file contained a lower case 'l' for light, whereas
in our HTML Light contained an upper case 'L'.

1.js functionality
    *   event listener from submit to on 'keyup'
    *   issue with roast.selection changed the case for roast type to match HTML and js
    *   add coffee function:
            - event listener to our submit button
            - moved e.preventDefault() to createCoffee to keep page from reloading
                when the submit button is pressed
            - vars for event listeners addCoffeeRoast/newCoffeeName
            - newCoffee() creating new obj and adds to coffee array
            - then if condition in addCoffee() checks if the input is not an empty string
            - then runs newCoffee() and then runs updateCoffees();
