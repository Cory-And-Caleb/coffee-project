Talking points

Cory - start/show page and js up to if condition newCoffee()
Caleb - newCoffee() end on map.resize()
Cory - quick overview HTML CSS

1.js functionality
    *   changed roast.selection changed the case for roast type to match HTML and js
    *   add coffee function:
            - moved event listener to our submit button
            - moved e.preventDefault() to createCoffee to keep page from reloading
                when the submit button is pressed
            - vars for event listeners addCoffeeRoast/newCoffeeName
            - newCoffee() creating new obj and adds to coffee array
            - then if condition in addCoffee() checks if the input is not an empty string
            - then runs newCoffee() and then runs updateCoffees();
