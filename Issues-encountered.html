Issues encountered on Coffee Project

1.  We encountered an issue with our roast.selection values not matching
the values set for our select options. It would not allow us to properly
display the filtered results by roast. For example our property value set
for our object in our js file contained a lower case 'l' for light, whereas
in our HTML Light contained an upper case 'L'.
